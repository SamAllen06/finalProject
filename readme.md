Budgeting Tool Proposal
Sam Allen, CSCI 121

# Purpose
This project demonstrates proficiency in key ideas learned in CSCI 121, such as Object-Oriented Programming, use of data structures, and file IO. 

# Overview
- This budgeting tool will be used to automate tasks I do for my budget. 
- It will use classes to embody different parts of my budget, such as record keeping and monetary allocation, in addition to an abstract class containing useful methods for handling the arrays and organizing the data that both other classes will inherit. 
- It will also use array lists to organize data and know how to handle the data in different ways. 
- The tool will be highly editable to fit different customers present and future needs. 
- Ultimately, the data will be saved as a file openable to excel so that the customer can view it that way as well. Therefore, it will also have to be able to be loadable from an excel file. 
- In order to do this, an arraylist will be used to handle a single row of data. These will be put into an arraylist corresponding to which row they are. 
- There will be a third arraylist that doesn't correspond to any particular row but contains information used to let the program know how to manipulate the data in each column of the monetary allocation class, since some need to be entered by the user, the date needs to be formatted, and some have to contain a value corresponding to a certain percent of an amount of money. This will be made serializable in order to easily save and load it, since it is not needed to be included in the excel file. 

# Anticipated Use Cases
- This will be used specifically for people to handle their budget. It is made to be flexible so people can set it up according to their own needs but then it will handle all of the automatic processes and formatting by itself.
